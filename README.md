#Book Recommendation using Retrieval Augmented Generation
#RAG:
Retrieval Augmented Generation is an AI framework that fuses conventional
retrieval with the generative approach. The Retrieval Augmented Generation aims
to enhance a chatbot’s ability to understand user input, retrieve pertinent
information without hallucinations, and dynamically generate tailored responses.
The project addresses the challenge of personalized book recommendations
through the development of a chatbot utilizing Retrieval Augmented Generation
with a vector database. We develop an intelligent system that not only comprehends
similarity between texts but also generates relevant and personalized book
recommendations based on a user’s previously liked books
#Frameworks:
There are many frameworks popularly used for Generative AI. Two prominent tools,
LlamaIndex and LangChain, have emerged as powerful options for improving the
interaction and functionality of these models. Another less popular alternative is
Haystack.
LangChain enhances the performance of LLMs with its versatile set of features and
functionalities. It is employed for applications needing continuous, context-heavy
conversations, such as chatbots and virtual assistants, as it allows models to
maintain coherent dialogues over extended periods.

Hence LangChain was selected as the framework for this project.
